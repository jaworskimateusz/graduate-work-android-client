# Graduate work android client
This work presents an android application for employees of a production company. The second component is REST web service, which allows sharing and downloading data from it.
    Nowadays, one of the key factors for the development and prosperity of a company is time. The application will have a QR code reader. The user will easily be able to scan the unique code of the device and send it to the webservice. He does not have to enter the entire string manually. The feedback will get the data of the machine in order to carry out a review, obtain information, and report a bug. Most devices are updated, the operating instructions are changed. Another feature will be downloading the user manual in PDF format to mobile applications. This will give you access to the latest version of this document. Employees will be able to send reports describing the solutions to a given problem. People from the management team can also send the employee a task in which he is to perform his service.
